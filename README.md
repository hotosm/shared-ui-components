## Shared UI Components with HOT Theming

This repository contains HOT themed UI components to reduce code duplication
and simplify the lives of developers needing to prototype and develop well
designed web applications quickly.

They are available as
[Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components)
with support for usage in [almost all](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com)
modern web frameworks.

The main goal of this project is not to re-invent the wheel, or add an extra burden
of development and maintenance.

## Quick start

There are two options: NPM and Components Bundle.

### NPM

Appropriate for applications that have installable dependencies

`npm install @hotosm/ui`

Import the library in your project and use the components.

```html
<script>
  import '@hotosm/ui/dist/style.css';
  import '@hotosm/ui/dist/hotosm-ui.js';
</script>
```

```html
<hot-logo><hot-logo>
```

#### React

```js
  import { Logo } from '@hotosm/ui/components/react';
```

```jsx
<Logo />
```

### Components Bundle

- This is the compiled JavaScript bundle generated from the TypeScript code.
- The components require no additional dependencies and are minified.

Appropriate for HTML / Markdown / HTMX.

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotosm-ui/latest/style.css"
/>

<script
  type="module"
  src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotosm-ui/latest/dist/hotosm-ui.js"
></script>

<hot-logo></hot-logo>
```  

## Using Extra Shoelace Components

The HOT UI library contains many composite components, such as headers, sidebars,
tracking banners, etc, and does not re-invent the wheel for low-level components.

Shoelace is an UI library that is exported directly from `@hotosm/ui`.

To access the low-level components, such as buttons, dropdowns, modals, etc,
simply import the component of the same name from the [Shoelace docs]
(<https://shoelace.style>):

```js
import '@hotosm/ui/components/button/button';
```

```html
<hot-button disabled variant="secondary">Can't Click Me</hot-button>
```

### React Shoelace Wrappers

```js
import { Button } from '@hotosm/ui/components';
```

```html
<Button disabled variant="secondary">Can't Click Me</Button>
```

### Examples

You can found examples for HTML and also all common frameworks
(React, Svelte, Vue) under `/examples`.

### Development

HOT UI is developed in TypeScript, using Lit and @lit/react.

Primarily we want to have:

- Low level components exported from the Shoelace web component
  library, simply re-exported with our default styling / CSS overrides.
- A few composite components (header, sidebar, etc):
  - Consistent styling across most of our tools where it counts.
  - Reduction in duplicated logic, such as user management, OAuth login, etc.
- Improved developer experience, reduced development time for new tools, while
  maintaining consistency in look and feel of applications.

### How to contribute

- Clone the project `git clone git@github.com:hotosm/ui.git`
- Install dependencies `pnpm install`
- Run the storybook `pnpm run dev`
- Write code!

There's also a React storybook that you can use for testing:

- Run the React storybook `pnpm run dev-react`

For **styling**, we have 2 important files under `/theme`:

- `hot-sl.css` has a Shoelace theme, re-defining styles variables
