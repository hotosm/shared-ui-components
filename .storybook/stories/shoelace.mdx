# Shoelace
 
The HOT UI library contains many composite components, such as headers, sidebars,
tracking banners, etc, and does not re-invent the wheel for low-level components.

Shoelace is an UI library that is exported directly from @hotosm/ui.

To access the low-level components, such as buttons, dropdowns, modals, etc,
simply import the component of the same name from Shoelace
but with the **`hot-`** prefix instead of **`sl-`**, or without prefix if you're using React.

For example, a button:

```html
<hot-button variant="primary">Click me!</hot-button>
```

Or if you're using React:

```jsx
<Button variant="primary">Click me!</Button>
```

<Canvas of={ShoelaceStories.Example} />

Check the [Shoelace's documentation](https://shoelace.style/components) for full docs.
