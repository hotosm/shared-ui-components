# React 19 Demo

This example uses the web component directly, supported from React v19 onwards.

## Running

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will serve the app using the web components on <http://localhost:3000>

## Info

- Note that in typical React style, the events are prefixed with `on`.
- So the event `undo` becomes `onundo`.
